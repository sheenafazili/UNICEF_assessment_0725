*----------------------------------------------------------------------
  * 2) Define user-dependant path for local clone repo
  *-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  * Change here only if this repo is renamed
  local this_repo     "UNICEF_assessment_0725"
  * Change here only if this master run do-file is renamed
  local this_run_do   "021_run.do"


  * One of two options can be used to "know" the clone path for a given user
  * A. the user had previously saved their GitHub location with -whereis-,
  *    so the clone is a subfolder with this Project Name in that location
  * B. through a window dialog box where the user manually selects a file

  * Method A - Github location stored in -whereis-
  *---------------------------------------------
  capture whereis github
  if _rc == 0 global clone "`r(github)'/`this_repo'/02_programs"

  * Method B - clone selected manually
  *---------------------------------------------
  else {
    * Display an explanation plus warning to force the user to look at the dialog box
    noi disp as txt `"{phang}Your GitHub clone local could not be automatically identified by the command {it: whereis}, so you will be prompted to do it manually. To save time, you could install -whereis- with {it: ssc install whereis}, then store your GitHub location, for example {it: whereis github "C:/Users/AdaLovelace/GitHub"}.{p_end}"'
    noi disp as error _n `"{phang}Please use the dialog box to manually select the file `this_run_do' in your machine.{p_end}"'

    * Dialog box to select file manually
    capture window fopen path_and_run_do "Select the master do-file for this project (`this_run_do'), expected to be inside any path/`this_repo'/" "Do Files (*.do)|*.do|All Files (*.*)|*.*" do

    * If user clicked cancel without selecting a file or chose a file that is not a do, will run into error later
    if _rc == 0 {

      * Pretend user chose what was expected in terms of string lenght to parse
      local user_chosen_do   = substr("$path_and_run_do",   - strlen("`this_run_do'"),     strlen("`this_run_do'") )
      local user_chosen_path = substr("$path_and_run_do", 1 , strlen("$path_and_run_do") - strlen("`this_run_do'") - 1 )

      * Replace backward slash with forward slash to avoid possible troubles
      local user_chosen_path = subinstr("`user_chosen_path'", "\", "/", .)

      * Check if master do-file chosen by the user is master_run_do as expected
      * If yes, attributes the path chosen by user to the clone, if not, exit
      if "`user_chosen_do'" == "`this_run_do'"  global clone "`user_chosen_path'"
      else {
        noi disp as error _newline "{phang}You selected $path_and_run_do as the master do file. This does not match what was expected (any path/`this_repo'/`this_run_do'). Code aborted.{p_end}"
        error 2222
      }
    }
  }

  * Regardless of the method above, check clone
  *---------------------------------------------
  * Confirm that clone is indeed accessible by testing that master run is there
  cap confirm file "${clone}/`this_run_do'"
  if _rc != 0 {
    noi disp as error _n `"{phang}Having issues accessing your local clone of the `this_repo' repo. Please double check the clone location specified in the run do-file and try again.{p_end}"'
    error 2222
  }
